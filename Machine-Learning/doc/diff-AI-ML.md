| Artificial Intelligence | Machine learning |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Artificial intelligence is a technology which enables a machine to simulate human behavior |Machine learning is a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn from past data without programming explicitly |
| The goal of AI is to make a smart computer system like humans to solve complex problems |The goal of ML is to allow machines to learn from data so that they can give accurate output |
| In AI, we make intelligent systems to perform any task like a human. |In ML, we teach machines with data to perform a particular task and give an accurate result |
| Machine learning and deep learning are the two main subsets of AI |Deep learning is a main subset of machine learning |
| AI has a very wide range of scope | Machine learning has a limited scope |
| AI is working to create an intelligent system which can perform various complex tasks | Machine learning is working to create machines that can perform only those specific tasks for which they are trained |
| AI system is concerned about maximizing the chances of success. |Machine learning is mainly concerned about accuracy and patterns |
| The main applications of AI are Siri, customer support using catboats, Expert System, Online game playing, intelligent humanoid robot, etc. |The main applications of machine learning are Online recommender system, Google search algorithms, Facebook auto friend tagging suggestions, etc |
| On the basis of capabilities, AI can be divided into three types, which are, Weak AI, General AI, and Strong AI. |Machine learning can also be divided into mainly three types that are Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, and Reinforcement learning |
| It includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction.	It includes learning and self-correction when introduced with new data |
| AI completely deals with Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. |Machine learning deals with Structured and semi-structured data |
