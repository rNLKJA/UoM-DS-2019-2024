<div align=center><h1>Data Science Path from Undergradate to Master</h1></div>

This repository store the notes about everything I learned from [UoM](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) [Data Science Major](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/major/data-science/) and other online sources from 2019 to 2024. 
For me, this is more like a revision notes / cheatsheet for my future data science releated career. 

If you notice something not so clear or errors or contents that confusing to other audiences, just start an issue and let's see what we can improve on it.
Also, if there is a better way for categorisation, don't be hesitate starting a new issue! Let's make DS life more easier!

One thing I like to mention is although I may paraphrase some concept in my own words, sometimes I will directly copy past the concept from others' work. 
You can always find the original page just follow the reference page. Maybe the original content could give you a better understanding.
