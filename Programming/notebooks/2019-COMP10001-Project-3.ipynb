We combine these together into a single question in Grok as a means of validating that you have a complete player that is qualified to enter the tournament. Note that in each case, we provide only a single test case (and no hidden test cases) for two reasons: (1) there are very few game states where there is a single possible option to either play a discard or group the discards, and testing relies on there only being one possible output; and (2) the real testing occurs in simulation mode in the actual tournament, in the form of random games against other players.
