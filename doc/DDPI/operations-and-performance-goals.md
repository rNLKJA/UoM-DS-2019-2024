# Opertaions and Performance Goals

## Alignment Failure

The internet of things or IoT is changing the way organization do works. The ability to collect data from any process at any point or time is almost unparalleled. That an organisation has data but it doesn't provide information or supportive evidence to make a better business decision.

**Data vs. Information**
- Information is gained from the proper use and analysis of data.
- The ability to collect infinite data is meaningless if it cannot transformed into usable information.

**Failure to Align Operations and Performance Goals**:

Two main outcomes
1. Lost opportunities, wasted resources, and unfavorable business performance.
2. An organisation collects and measures the wrong metrics.

**Strategy Deployment**
- Works to ensure objectives are aligned and connected to daily work through 'catchball'.
- Identify three - five critical objectives.
- Use 'catchball' to choose Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each objective.

The strategy deployment tool called catchball refers to a method of obtaining input from lower levels of the organisation to inform decisions made at higher levels.
With the catchball process, ideas are sent down through lower layers of the organisation, allowing those individuals to reach to and make suggestions that move back up the chain of command.

Feedback loops are important for connecting high-level objectives with day-to-day execution. Time and energy can be conserved by vetting strategies before they are executed.

KPIs allow management to track progress, thereby driving desired behaviors. So KPIs should be identified for all key objectives.
