### Web Information Technologies

The Web has radically changed society, politics, science, business and the way people work. This subject introduces the concepts, technologies and standards underpinning the World Wide web and its applications. You will learn to apply tools and techniques required to model, design and develop applications for the web that can run on one or more platforms. Topics covered include the infrastructure of the web; the architecture of web applications; data representation and structure of the web; modeling and development processes for Web applications; security and social aspects of the Web. This subject assumes background programming skills and the basics of algorithmic thinking. These skills are combined with incremental and iterative development to develop functional and creative web applications that can support specific requirements or aspects of human work or social behaviour.

This note provide fundamental aspects of the Web: 
- client server model
- modelling of web applications (modelling data, content, functional aspets and navigation)
- incremental and iterative design and development of web application
- usability aspects and testing of web applications, and web security.

Under this folder, the frontend will focus on React application and the backend will focus on the Flask framework. If you are interested in node, expressjs server, or handlebar, you may want to check my notes on [notion](https://www.notion.so/huangsunchuangyu/Revision-Notes-1c28fa0266754024800b9f661eb2cc4b). This notion contains basic ideas of web application development.
