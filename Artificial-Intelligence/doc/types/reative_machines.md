### Reactive Machines
- Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.
- Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.
- These machines only focus on current scenarios and react on it as per possible best action.
- IBM's Deep Blue system is an example of reactive machines.
- Google's AlphaGo is also an example of reactive machines.
