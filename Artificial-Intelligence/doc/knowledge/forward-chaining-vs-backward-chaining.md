### Forward Chaining vs. Backward Chaining

| Forward Chaining | Backward Chaining |
| ---- | ---- |
| Forward chaining starts from known facts and applied inference rule to extract more data unit it reaches to the goal | Backward chaining starts from the goal and works backward through inference rules to find the required facts that support the goal |
| It is a bottom-up approach | It is a top-down approach |
| Forward chaining is known as data-driven inference technique as we reach to the goal using the available data | Backward chaining is known as a goal-driven technique as we start from the goal and divide into sub-goal to extract the facts |
| Forward chaining reasoning appplies a breadth-first search strategy | Backward chaining reasoning applies a depth-frist search strategy |
| Forward chaining tests for all the available rules | Backward chaining only tests for few required rules |
| Forward chaining is suitable for the planning, monitoring, control, and interpretation application | Backward chaining is suitable for diagnostic, prescription, and debugging application |
| Forward chaining can generate an infinite number of possible conclusions | Backward chaining generates a finite number of possible conclusions |
| It operates in the forward direction | It operates in the backward direction |
| Forward chaining is aimed for any conclusion | Backward chaining is only aimed for the required data |
