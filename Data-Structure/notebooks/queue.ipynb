    "### Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or front of the queue, analogously to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as enqueue, and the operation of removing an element from the front is known as dequeue. Other operations may also be allowed, often including a peek or front operation that returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables insert operations to be performed at one end called REAR and delete operations to be performed at another end called FRONT.\n",

    "\n",
    "Due to the fact that queue performs actions on first in first out basis which is quite fair for the ordering of actions. There are vaious applications of queues discussed as below.\n",
    "- Queues are widely used as waiting lists for a single shared resource like printer, disk, CPU.\n",
    "- Queues are used in asynchronous transfer of data (where data is not being transferred at the same rate between two processes) for eg. pipes, file IO, sockets.\n",
    "- Queues are used as buffers in most of the applications like MP3 media player, CD player, etc.\n",
    "- Queue are used to maintain the play list in media players in order to add and remove the songs from the play-list.\n",
    "- Queues are used in operating systems for handling interrupts.\n",

    "#### What is a Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue is the data structure that is similar to the queue in the real world. A queue is a data structure in which whatever comes first will go out first, and it follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) policy. Queue can also be defined as the list or collection in which the insertion is done from one end known as the rear end or the tail of the queue, whereas the deletion is done from another end known as the front end or the head of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real-world example of a queue is the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the person who enters first in the queue gets the ticket first, and the last person enters in the queue gets the ticket at last. Similar approach is followed in the queue in data structure.\n",

    "The representation of the queue is shown in the below image:\n",

    "#### Simple Queue or Linear Queue\n",
    "In Linear Queue, an insertion takes place from one end while the deletion occurs from another end. The end at which the insertion takes place is known as the rear end, and the end at which the deletion takes place is known as front end. It strictly follows the FIFO rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ds-types-of-queue3](../img/ds-types-of-queue3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The major drawback of using a linear Queue is that insertion is done only from the rear end. If the first three elements are deleted from the Queue, we cannot insert more elements even though the space is available in a Linear Queue. In this case, the linear Queue shows the overflow condition as the rear is pointing to the last element of the Queue."

    "The drawback that occurs in a linear queue is overcome by using the circular queue. If the empty space is available in a circular queue, the new element can be added in an empty space by simply incrementing the value of rear. The main advantage of using the circular queue is better memory utilization."
